# 🚀 ProdByBuddha  
### Agentic Infrastructure Architect | Rust ML Systems | Economic & Compute Governance

I build production-grade systems: high-performance inference, distributed orchestration, secure execution, and economic engines that make compute sustainable.

---

## 🧠 What I’m actually good at (holistic)

### Systems & Infra
- High-performance / low-latency design
- Containerization (Docker/Podman/Orbstack) + orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Observability-first architectures
- DevSecOps constraints & sandboxing

### AI & Reasoning Systems
- Inference pipelines (ONNX/ORT, vLLM, Candle)
- Agent orchestration & tool ecosystems
- Retrieval + memory systems (pragmatic, not academic)

### Economic Compute & Decision Engines
- CAC/LTGP + capital-efficiency modeling
- Compute tier governance + subsidy logic
- “Automation dividend” modeling and deployment economics

## 🐬 Signature Systems (best-of)

- **Agency** — Rust microservices constellation for autonomous reasoning + memory + voice, designed for concurrency + isolation.
- **Compute Commons** — framework for decentralized GPU coordination + economic governance.
- **OpenAPI MCP Server** — universal OpenAPI → MCP tool generation for high-speed agent toolchains.
- **infra-as-an-organism** — infrastructure treated as a self-aware system: feedback loops, governance, adaptation.
- **ltgp_cac_calculator** — Rust CLI economics engine for go-to-market & capital allocation.
- **Personal AI Infrastructure** — a pragmatic, deployable local inference stack that balances performance, cost, and control.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Summary

**Languages:** Rust, TypeScript, Python, C++  
**AI/ML:** ONNX, ONNX Runtime, Candle, vLLM, retrieval pipelines  
**Infra:** Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, edge/VPS clusters, GitHub Actions  
**Tooling:** CLI-first design, OpenAPI automation, agent orchestration

## 🎯 Operating Principles

- System-level leverage over feature velocity
- Performance as a first-class constraint
- Economic resilience as an architectural requirement
- Open ecosystems over closed silos
