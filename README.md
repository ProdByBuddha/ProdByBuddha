## What I Do (Design × Engineering)

- Outcome‑driven UX for complex systems: turn dense business demands into clear, guided flows.

## Signature Work (authored, not just forked)

- OpenAPI MCP Server (<24 hours from idea → docs → CI)
  - Universal OpenAPI → MCP tool generator with multi‑service host (n8n + Hostinger + more)
  - Hardened defaults, Zod validation, stdio + WebSocket transport, HTML test client
  - Auto‑built GitHub Wiki and Actions that lint specs, regen tools, and publish docs
  - Repo: https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/openapi-mcp-server

- Coinbase × Agent Kit (TypeScript)
  - Rebuilt for Replit Agent; model‑agnostic UX; cleaner onboarding and examples
  - Repo: https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/Coinbase-x-Agent-Kit

- Bank Account (Rust)
  - Security‑focused terminal banking prototype (AES‑256, JWT+JWE, PCI‑style checks)
  - Repo: https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/bank-account-rust

- Information Theory (Python)
  - Practical, readable implementations from Shannon to modern variants
  - Repo: https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/information-theory

- ESP32 Projects (C++)
  - Embedded UX: feedback‑rich CLIs, robust error paths, dev‑friendly logs
  - Repo: https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/esp32-projects

> Note on forks: I fork to move quickly, then contribute. I don’t list clones here. Public commits reflect where I actually shipped.

## Design Principles I practice

- Clarity over cleverness: label things the way users search for them.
- States, not pages: empty/loading/error states designed first, not last.
- Safety rails > speed bumps: guide users to success, block foot‑guns.
- Motion with meaning: subtle transitions for orientation, not decoration.
- Accessibility is table stakes: contrast, focus rings, keyboard paths, ARIA.

## Process (fast, transparent, verifiable)

1) Understand constraints: users, auth, transports, risks, success criteria
2) Design the interface: names, flows, states, microcopy, examples
3) Generate > hand‑code: OpenAPI → tools/server/types; curate what matters
4) Prove it works: HTML client, examples, one‑shot scripts
5) Ship with confidence: Wiki, CI, linting, and regeneration pipelines

## Let’s build something your users love

- You want complex capability to feel simple, safe, and fast.
- I deliver that — with artifacts your team can maintain.
