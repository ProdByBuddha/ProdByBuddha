## The Intersection: Where I Operate

I sit at the bleeding edge between **infrastructure engineering** and **autonomous agents**. I don't just build applications; I engineer "organisms"—systems that are self-healing, context-aware, and capable of complex reasoning.

My work focuses on the **last mile of AI utility**: optimizing inference engines (vLLM), hardening orchestration layers (n8n), and designing data pipelines that allow LLMs to act, not just chat.

## 🧬 Philosophy: Infrastructure as an Organism

> *"Static systems are fragile. Biological systems are anti-fragile."*

I build software that treats infrastructure like biological tissue. My methodology, **[Infra-as-an-Organism](https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/infra-as-an-organism)**, prioritizes:
- **Homeostasis:** Systems that self-regulate under load.
- **Autonomy:** Agents that understand their own constraints.
- **Symbiosis:** Tightly coupled interactions between Model (Intelligence) and Tool (Action).

## 🚀 High-Impact Open Source Contributions

My acumen is proven in the codebases powering the AI revolution.

### **Inference & Compute**
- **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/30449) (Contributor)**
  - *Context:* The world's fastest high-throughput and memory-efficient LLM serving engine.
  - *Contribution:* Direct contributions to the core engine, enhancing stability and performance for production-grade inference.

### **Orchestration & Agents**
- **[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases/tag/n8n%401.119.0) (Contributor)**
  - *Context:* The leading fair-code workflow automation tool for technical teams.
  - *Contribution:* Addressed critical logic in agentic workflows (Issue [#18574](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/18574)), shipped in release `1.119.0`. I ensure the glue between LLMs and APIs is robust.

- **[Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/12941) (Contributor)**
  - *Context:* Google's official command-line interface for the Gemini models.
  - *Contribution:* Enhanced developer tooling to streamline interaction with multimodal models.

## 🛠️ Signature Projects (The Agentic Stack)

I build at every layer of the autonomous stack: **Inference**, **Tooling**, **Execution**, and **Security**.

### 🧠 Inference Layer: [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
**Contribution:** SLA-Tiered Scheduling & Core Stability<br>
I don't just use LLMs; I optimize how they run.
- **The Work:** Proposed and architected **SLA-Tiered Scheduling** ([RFC #30256](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/30256)) to allow vLLM to intelligently balance latency-critical agents vs. throughput-heavy batch jobs.
- **Impact:** Moves inference from "First-Come-First-Serve" to "Business-Logic-Aware."

### 🔌 Tooling Layer: [OpenAPI MCP Server](https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/openapi-mcp-server)
**Project:** The Universal API Adapter for Agents<br>
A zero-config factory that instantly turns *any* OpenAPI/Swagger spec into a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
- **Why it matters:** Solves the "cold start" problem for agents. Instead of writing glue code for every API, this tool generates strict, type-safe tool definitions (Zod) automatically.
- **Features:** Auto-generated Wiki/Docs, GitHub Actions CI pipelines, and multi-service hosting (n8n + Hostinger).

### 💳 Execution Layer: [Coinbase × Agent Kit](https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/Coinbase-x-Agent-Kit)
**Project:** Financial Autonomy for AI<br>
A complete re-engineering of the Coinbase Agent Kit for the Replit ecosystem.
- **The Delta:** I stripped away the friction to create a **model-agnostic UX**, allowing agents to hold wallets, stake assets, and execute complex on-chain transactions without human intervention.

### 🛡️ Security Layer: [Bank Account (Rust)](https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/bank-account-rust)
**Project:** High-Assurance Systems Prototype<br>
A terminal banking system proving that "Agentic" doesn't mean "Insecure."
- **Tech:** Written in Rust for memory safety. Implements **AES-256 encryption**, **JWT+JWE auth**, and **PCI-compliant** architectural patterns.
- **Philosophy:** If an agent can spend money, its underlying logic must be panic-free and formally verifiable.

### 🧬 Philosophy: [Infra-as-an-Organism](https://github.com/ProdByBuddha/infra-as-an-organism)
**Concept:** The Manual for Self-Healing Systems<br>
My manifesto on moving from "static architecture" to "biological architecture."
- **Core Tenet:** Infrastructure should possess *homeostasis*—automatically regulating resources (like the vLLM scheduler) to maintain health under stress.
